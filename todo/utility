add little-endian, big-endian types, which can automatically translate
    - on assignment or reading it translates depending on the platform it was compiled for
    - le< u64 >, be< s32 > or possible little_endian< u64 >, big_endian< s32 > templates

consider removing operator type*() from pointer
    - this would ensure that pointer could not be accidentally abused

create lazy_ptr and relative_ptr
    - lazy_ptr will create the object on first access (and is atomic in creation)
    - relative_ptr for memory mapped objects
    - relative_ptr has two parts, a base pointer and a relative offset

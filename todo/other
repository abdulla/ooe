add translate/localisation functions
	- use gettext or similar

more use of exceptions
	- wherever return values can be unchecked, ie boolean returns

two-pass rendering
	- z-buffer only, then pixels?
	- sort only by shader/texture (early z-pass)?

scene graph should do all the video resource management
	- only it should know about screen dimensions

move to xcb for x11
	- use xcb instead of libx11

extend setup_path
	- use GetModuleFileName() under windows
	- read /proc/curproc/file on freebsd
	- would using realpath() help to resolve paths?

scheduler layered on top of ipc
	- useful for guaranteeing that no one process can hog processing

multi-thread aware scene graph
	- able to have multiple threads working on the scene-graph together
	- no changes are made directly to scene graph, but are requested
	- before frame is rendered, all requests are applied (perhaps limited by time or depth)

lexical_cast/numeric_cast
	- used boost *_casts, they are simpler and do more verification

double buffered buffers
	- double buffering with vbo's in opengl gives a performance boost
	- rendering from one buffer, while modifying the other, then switch each frame

write new generalised main loop
	- focus on sleeping and coalescing wake ups
	- make subsystems independent - rendering doesn't rely on main loop, but wakes on animate

make all constructors explicit
	- something that should have been done a long time ago, but wasn't, due to laziness

use openctm for models
	- no need for custom model format

add translate/localisation functions
	- use gettext or similar

more use of exceptions
	- wherever return values can be unchecked, ie boolean returns

two-pass rendering
	- z-buffer only, then pixels?
	- sort only by shader/texture (early z-pass)?

move to xcb for x11
	- use xcb instead of libx11

extend setup_path
	- use GetModuleFileName() under windows
	- read /proc/curproc/file on freebsd
	- would using realpath() help to resolve paths?

extend socket descriptor send and receive
	- use WSADuplicateSocket() under windows

lexical_cast/numeric_cast
	- used boost *_casts, they are simpler and do more verification

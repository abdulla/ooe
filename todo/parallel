create some sorta dependency tree with schedule
	- possibly find a way of create trees of work
	- create a framework for pumping dependent tasks through schedule
	- take a schedule reference, have a list of tasks, each tasks has an iterator range of depends

a nice graph-based parallelisation architecture
	- with a nice syntax like dot:
		serial( f1 ) -> parallel( f2, 10 )
		serial( f1 ) -> serial( f3 )
	- this says that f2 and f3 depend on f1, f2 is run 10 times and can be parallel
	- this also says f3 is can be run in parallel to f2, but is a serial task
	- f* can use closures to pack in data
	- maybe serial/parallel distinction is not needed, and simply a node syntax

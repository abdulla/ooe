----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

have "static std::string name( void )" that is used to get test name

OOE_TEMPLATE std::string fixture_type::name< 0 >( void )
{
    return ...;
}

OOE_TEMPLATE void fixture_type::test< 0 >( ... )
{
    ...
}

add the ability to benchmark tests with a -b option (possibly have -w for warmup iterations and -s
for seconds to benchmark for).

have timer thread that'll flip flag in benchmark thread once the timer expires, then spit out
details as ops/sec and amount of iterations and time taken.

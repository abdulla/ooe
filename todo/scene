make text node
	- what should be added to make this flexible?
	- should this inherit from a billboard node? or just be child of billboard node in tree?

modify chunked async_tasks to query chunk state for operation
	- instead of explicitly request load/unload, send in function that'll query state and proceed
	- this should help remove strain with fast movement and consecutive load/unload on chunks

look at using openctm for models
	- this would save a lot of trouble with custom model formats

remove support for multiple transports
	- unify on a semaphore only
	- possibly should wait until paper is complete

asynchronous rpc wrapper
	- have a similar set up to nipc, have a background thread pumping across the transport
	- have an async_client, wraps a client with background thread
	- have result template that can block on result of async rpc call

can merge traits of both socket and memory
	- buffer can be reused for socket, and the setup stage can be different
	- can simplify buffer by using socket traits scheme of pre-determining size
	- should also help with performance for memory, as multiple shared-memory regions aren't alloc'd

could use sendfile or equivalent to pass data to /dev/null
	- data would not have to be copied to user-space and the kernel could destroy the buffers

could modify usage of write_buffer in switchboard for memory--based ipc, and unify
	- not have so many parameters to the callbacks and reuse the write_buffer

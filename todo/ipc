remove support for multiple transports
	- unify on a semaphore only
	- possibly should wait until paper is complete

asynchronous rpc wrapper
	- have a similar set up to nipc, have a background thread pumping across the transport
	- have an async_client, wraps a client with background thread
	- have result template that can block on result of async rpc call

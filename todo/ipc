asynchronous rpc wrapper
    - have a similar set up to socket, have a background thread pumping across the transport
    - have an async_client, wraps a client with background thread
    - have result template that can block on result of async rpc call

add a way to replay responses
    - this could be used for unit testing

look at a linux-specific way to accelerate IPC
    - sys_process_vm_read() and sys_process_vm_write(): http://lwn.net/Articles/405346
    - directed yield with yield_to(): http://lwn.net/Articles/419961

externalise server socket in IPC, so that surrogates can poll for HUP
    - sockets are handed directly to server::accept() as an argument
    - sockets can be polled for HUP, allowing surrogates to shutdown on client disconnection

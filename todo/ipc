remove support for multiple transports
	- unify on a semaphore only
	- possibly should wait until paper is complete

asynchronous rpc wrapper
	- have a similar set up to nipc, have a background thread pumping across the transport
	- have an async_client, wraps a client with background thread
	- have result template that can block on result of async rpc call

have way of replaying responses
	- this could be used for unit testing

modify error to return idempotency
	- basically, it should return a value to indicate whether the function was called or not
	- this can then be used to build idempotency at the application-level, in a cheap manner

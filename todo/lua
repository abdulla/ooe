proper namespaces and modules
	- like in luabind, with operator[]
	- maybe use environments?
	- do it by expanding table, so proper lua terminology
	- use lua's actual module system

use environment tables for types
	- requires exporting types in standard lua module way
	- environment tables can be attached to lua functions
	- they are the tables where global names in lua functions are resolved at run time
	- lua 5.1 extended environment tables to C functions, userdata, and threads

modify table::iterator and make in to template
	- allow for types other than string to be returned
	- different types on dereference?

allow lua object calls
	- add operator() to table to allow calls to lua objects

overload function that creates overloads
	- lua::overload that explicitly creates overloads when needed
	- creates object that uses metamethod __call, which then calls correact overload
	- uses number of arguments given to call appropriate overload
	- can be used for all functions, including constructors
	- store overloads in metatable, storing functions at index depending on their arity

add lua process shell
	- allows for a whole program to be written in lua

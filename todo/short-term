quad-tree based combine_source

make font_source store data in png to reduce IO and space on disk

support: http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/texture_compression_rgtc.txt

make text shader read from framebuffer to correctly get background to mix font with

add a wrapper around map_ptr that provides a simple way to write primitives
- protected_map->write< u8, 4 >( source ) --- to write 4 u8s
- should also check that no writes occur beyond the end of the buffer
- possibly a buffer creation type too, protected_buffer< u8, 4, f32, 8 >::size

byte-swap functions should labelled with be/le and be from be/le to native
- these functions should work transparent of the host platform

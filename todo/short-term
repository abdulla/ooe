- quad-tree based combine_source

- modify font and font_source to operatate on glyph indices
- make text_layout glyph object containing glyph indices, then use that for input() and (new) load()
- use first_char/next_char to map from character to glyph, and store in font_source metric
- make font_source store data in png to reduce IO and space on disk

- support: http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/texture_compression_rgtc.txt

- make text shader read from framebuffer to correctly get background to mix font with

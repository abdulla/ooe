quad-tree based combine_source

make font_source store data in png to reduce IO and space on disk

support: http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/texture_compression_rgtc.txt

make text shader read from framebuffer to correctly get background to mix font with

modify checked_map to be a template based on a struct, forcing only writes of that struct

create a new font_source to store all three sub-pixel versions of a glyph
- this should also be flexible with sizes and layouts

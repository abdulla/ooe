replace maths with eigen2
	- uses expression templates like blitz++ but is sse optimised
	- other option is to roll my own, considering my limited needs, it is a possibility

use tr1::array
	- replace all array usage with tr1:arrays, which keep track of their size without using space

modify fonts to use native font manager
	- use fontconfig/etc where possible for fonts
	- multi-texture glyphs that require more than one texture
	- reuse allocated buffers for font layout and dynamic_draw
	- fontconfig on posix, ats on darwin
	- map character to pre-rendered glyph (texture + coords) using map, for fast rendering

use harfbuzz for text layout - or - use pango and render to bitmap
	- possibly stick with freetype for fonts and use harfbuzz for text layout
	- look at how qt and pango use harfbuzz
	- could use pango and cairo backend to render text, similar to what clutter does
